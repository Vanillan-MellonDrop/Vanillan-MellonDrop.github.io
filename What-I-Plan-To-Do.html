  <h1>What I Plan To Do</h1>
<p> I fully intend to make my own video games, but first, I want to pay off my student loans, and
spend some time honing what I've learned upon graduating Thaddeus Stevens
College of Technology. I'll see what's available locally for a software engineer, and maybe move
on to attempt to learn more at PennCo, who has a program that's video game specific.
After that, I might work on assisting an indie game development team in my own time while I
work under one of the bigger labels. I hope to truly learn as much as I can so I can make something
of my own that's worthwhile and long-lasting.<br>
<br> These are just some of the ideas that I've come up with on trying to continue to work on my
  coding capabilities as a marketable trade with my desire to eventually develop a video game that's
  fun for all genders and most ages. I want to continue honing my craft to one day make a brand that
  speaks to people and conveys tales of adventures, and truly challenges players on a level that we
  don't really see in video games as of yet. What better way towork towards making a better game
  than to dedicate a few years towards perfecting my skills until I feel I'm capable of making quality content?<br>
  <br>I reached a point where I didn't think I could go back to school to learn how to do all that I'm doing.
  I never dreamed I could undo my mistake of failing my first attempt at college. However, I've not
  only gone back, I've learned how to code things I never dreamed I'd be able to do, and I've
  succeeded in getting this far. I'll keep learning, coding, and during the summer, I'll even take on an
  internship so I can escape the summer slump. I don't just dream of getting better at coding. I planned out
  a series of long-term steps to keep on learning and doing because anything that takes this long, has got to
  be sincerely worth it.</p>
